# Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Project Overview


## Resources
- **Data Sources**: SQLite Database `hawaii.sqlite`
- **Software and Tools**: Python, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Jupyter Notebook & Git Bash 

## Challenge Overview
W. Avy likes my analysis but wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Challenge Results
### Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, I wrote a `for loop` to filter the date column of the Measurements table in the `hawaii.sqlite` database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June and append them to a list. Then, I created a DataFrame from the list, generated the summary statistics, and confirmed that they matched the image in the challenge assignment.

### Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, I refactored the `for loop` I wrote for the first deliverable, this time to filter the date column of the Measurements table in the `hawaii.sqlite` database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December and append them to a list. Then, I created a DataFrame from the list, generated the summary statistics, and confirmed that they matched the image in the challenge assignment.
